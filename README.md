Hey there!

I'm a software developer interested in building back-end systems. I also like to mess around with text editors and developer tools in general.

## What I'm currently doing at work
- REST APIs with Typescript and Python
- Asynchronous processing with RabbitMQ queues
- Telecom platforms based on SIP, SMPP and Diameter protocols

## Learning and side projects
- Distributed systems using (mostly using Elixir)
- Microservices and CLI tools (mostly using Go)
- Cloud infrastructure (mostly using GCP)
