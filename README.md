Hey there!

I'm a software developer interested in building back-end systems and operating infrastructure. I also like to mess around with text editors and developer tools in general.

I've been doing a lot in my [homelab](https://github.com/luissimas/homelab) lately, mostly for pleasure and for learning more about managing Kubernetes clusters. If you want to know more about what I've done in the past, check out my [personal website](https://luissimas.github.io/about/).
